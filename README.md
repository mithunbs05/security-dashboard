# Crowd Detection & Lost & Found System

## üìå Overview
The **Crowd Detection & Lost & Found System** is an AI-powered solution designed for managing large gatherings in **temples, festivals, events, and transportation hubs**.  
It leverages **NVIDIA DeepStream SDK** and **computer vision models** to monitor people flow, detect overcrowding, and assist in locating missing individuals.  

At its core, the system combines **real-time crowd density estimation**, **face recognition for lost & found**, and **alert mechanisms** to improve safety and efficiency in high-density environments.
